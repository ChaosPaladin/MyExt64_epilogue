== What is MyExt64 ==
MyExt64 is new opensource extender for l2off Gracia Final server
(l2_off_gracia_final). It uses some knowledge from OSIE extender,
MXC extender and maybe other extenders.

== Features ==
 * Supports protocols 83 (Gracia Final) and 152 (Gracia Epilogue update 1)
 * Protocol 87 (Gracia Final update 1) should be working but is not tested
 * Supports Gracia Epilogue skill enchanting + buy/sell (refund and mail not implemented yet)
 * Bunch of bugfixes (some ported from OSIE, some ported from MXC extender)
 * Voice commands - offline trade, experience gain on/off, server time, online player count
 * Configurable item enchant (safe/chances)
 * Custom drop/spoil rate algorithm
 * Custom event drop algorithm (flat chance based)
 * Players in the same command channel are treated as allies
 * Configurable max level for main/subclass
 * Global shout/trade
 * Vitality multiplier
 * Configurable clan restriction (penalties)
 * Configurable buff slot count + max divine inspiration bonus

== How to use it ==
If you're not familiar with l2off, it will probably require learning
some stuff (MXC forum is a good start).

To just use the last build, copy following files from server folder
in this repository to your server folder:

* MyExt64.dll - main extender file
* MyExt64.ini - extender configuration
* MyExt64Loader.exe - extender loader

and run the server via MyExt64Loader.exe

If you're more experienced with messing around PE files, you can add MyExt64.dll
to import table of L2Server.exe and add call to DllMain.

== How to compile it ==
You should get Visual Studio 2005. Maybe it would be possible to compile it
on some newer Visual Studio, but you'll have to define your own templates
for std::vector and std::map (and possibly more containers) to match memory
layout of their VS2005 versions.

MyExt64 has no external dependencies and requires only standard libraries
for Windows development.
